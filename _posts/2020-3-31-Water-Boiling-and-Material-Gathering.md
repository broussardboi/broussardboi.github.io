title: Water Boiling and Material Gathering
---
Before this, all water was drinkable, which isn't accurate. Players can now create a boiling pot to hang over a fire and boil water. This will turn fresh water into safe to drink water, but won't change salt water as that requires distillation. I've also added rock and stick spawning nodes as a way for new players to gather wood and stone without using tools.
