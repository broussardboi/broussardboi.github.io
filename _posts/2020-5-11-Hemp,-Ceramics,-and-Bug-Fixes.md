title: Hemp, Ceramics, and Bug Fixes
---
I added the hemp plant as a renewable source of fiber and grain. Using the mortar & pestle, you can grind hemp seeds into hemp flour to make bread with. The hemp plant grows just like the potato plant.

I also added the ceramic bowl and cup. The bowl is used in baking to hold flour. The cup is used to drink and water plants.

23 bugs were found and fixed. I am sure there are more bugs to be hunted, but I feel the majority of them were caught, put on trial, found guilty, and swiftly executed.  


Quality of life improvements include:
* Items added to the inventory go to the hotbar, not the main inventory  
* Items added are logged on the right side of the screen  
* Stat bars now show the numerical value as well as the sliding bar  



It's been a while since the last post. I've been lazy is all.
